C Library for reading .ini-style configuration files

The public interface is easy, it reads the config file into an structure that
makes for fast searching for sections and keys.  Just free it when done,
it's as simple as that. 

Why? This is something everyone seems to implement themselves -- and a few
times I've wished to be able use a backslash to to line-continuation of a
particular value if it were to be a paragraph.  Speaking of...

Values can be continued using a backslash -- any line ending with a trailing
'\' will cause the line below it to be joined to the value.  Even numbers of
backslashes are considered escaped and result in n/2 real backslashes ending
the line -- odd numbers are (n - 1) / 2 real backslashes with a continuation.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The format is simple and ubiquitous -- 
# Comments start with hash or semi-colon;
[section]
key = value

[another_section]
alpha = beta
gamma = delta epsilon

The key/value separator can be a colon as well -- whichever is seen first
scanning the line is considered as the right separator. Whitespace is stripped
around section-names, keys, and values.

Examples (quotes added to delineate the entire value):

key = this sentence will continue on to the next \
line right here.
==>
key = "this sentence will continue on to the next line right here."

key = this ends with two real backslashes \\\\
==>
key = "this ends with two real backslashes \\"

key = this continues with a trailing backslash \\\
onto the next line
==>
key = "this continues with a trailing backslash \onto the next line"
